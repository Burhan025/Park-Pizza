# Park-Pizza
In this project, I have developed a WordPress template for a brewery platform featuring dynamic menu management (e.g., beer, pizza), time-based menu switching (AM/PM), responsive layouts, accordion-style sections, and OpenTable integration. Enhanced Instagram integration, and used ACF and custom PHP for flexible, dynamic functionality.
